[`{modelscript}`](https://github.com/RobertMyles/modelscript) is a
little RStudio add-in I wrote to help me with modelling. I've been
testing out the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework for
R (fantastic, btw) and I thought it would be handy to be able to create
a new .R file with all the steps you'd need for most modelling tasks.
You can install it with
\`remotes::install_github("RobertMyles/modelscript"). A new RStudio
add-in will appear in the Addins menu that will create your R modelling
script:
<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

For anybody who'd like to make their own RStudio add-in, it was easy to
do. In RStudio, you can create a new section in an .R file with
`control shift R`, so I use this basic idea to create a template for all
(or most, depending on the application) of the steps you'd typically use
in any modelling task. Since we can interact with RStudio itself through
[rstudioapi](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rstudioapi/index.html),
it was quite straightforward to set it up as an RStudio add-in.

Basically, you create a new R package, create an
`inst/rstudio/addins.dcf` file in the package, and fill in the following
four entries:

    Name:
    Description:
    Binding:
    Interactive:

Mine is:

    Name: modelscript
    Description: Creates a modelling script template in a new .R file.
    Binding: modelscript
    Interactive: false

The Binding is the (R) function it calls, in this case a function called
`modelscript()`. This function is quite straightforward, it uses
`rstudioapi::documentNew()` to create a new .R file with the text I
wanted used. Once you install modelscript, refresh your Rsession and a
new entry on the RStudio Addins menu will appear, which you can click to
create the .R file as in the GIF above.

The template itlself contains a prep and a model building section.
'prep' contains subsections for:

- libraries
- data
- EDA
- tidy
- visualize

'Build Model' contains subsections for:

- 1: Initial Split
- 2: Preprocessing
- 3: Model Specification
- 4: Hyperparameter Tuning Specification
- 5: Bundle into Workflow
- 6: Cross Validation
- 7: Tune
- 8: Explore Tuning Results
- 9: Finalize Workflow
- 10: Final Fit
- 11: Evaluate

Obviously these might not all be used, or other parts might be needed,
or for example, the EDA - tidy - visualize part might be repeated, but
it's a nice helper for getting up and running. And you could of course
modify it for your own use and then make your own package and add-in. ðŸ¤“
