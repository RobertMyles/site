import { InlineMath, BlockMath } from "react-katex"

This post details how I use [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to blog about R stuff. If you're an R user and you have a blog, there's a fair chance you use [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). I used to, it's very handy. (I'm not suggesting ditching blogdown btw, I think it's fantastic. If that works for you, great.)

A few years ago, I started to take more interest in JavaScript, in particular [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). I also wanted to understand more of how websites were built, so I decided to rebuild mine with Gatsby. Gatsby is pretty easy to get started with, and I've found the docs quite good and the community helpful. The nice thing is that you have a lot of control over how your website looks and behaves. It utilises Facebook's [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to source data. The 'data' here are elements of your site -- making it really useful to render items, internal links etc by querying the data of the site. (If that last sentence makes no sense, see [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/why-gatsby-uses-graphql/). It is quite badly worded, now that I read it...anywayz.) For example, the list of my blog posts found [here](https://www.robertmylesmcdonnell.com/blog/) is done dynamically by querying the data of the site using GraphQL.

So the world of Gatsby websites is exciting and interesting, but what if you want to blog about R things still? The great thing about blogdown is that it fits so snugly into the RStudio ecosystem. So that's not going to be the same with Gatsby. There are a few things that you do gain, however, including some _really_ nice tools.

First of all, I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to work on any non-RMarkdown stuff for the site. VS Code for R is not great in my opinion, at least it doesn't compare to RStudio. But for JavaScript, it's _fantastic_.

Secondly, since there is such a ginormous JS/web developer community, there are lots of little tools to help with developing sites. For example, I use [Merge Schedule](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/merge-schedule) to automatically merge Pull Requests into the master branch of my site (although not particularly a JS-specific tool). This allows me to schedule blog posts, as I simply create a branch, write whatever I'm going to post, and push to the branch on GitHub. Using `schedule /<YEAR>-<MONTH>-<DAY>` in the PR description schedules it for merging. I've only been using this for a short while, but it's working well. This helps me to blog when I'm feeling productive and not have to do it when I'm not, so I hope to have a more regular blog schedule now, in terms of when the post appear on the site. Another one is [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/), which updates my JS packages for me. (While I'm here, using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) has highlighted the amazingness of [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) -- often I've been left with something breaking because of a package -- that doesn't happen often with R. Goooo CRAN! ðŸ¥³)

Thirdly, I use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for a flavour of Markdown that allows you to embed React components in the Markdown. This is quite similar to how you can run R code in RMarkdown. Where this gets useful is when you create a D3 chart as a React component. It can then be used whenever you like in your MDX-Markdown posts, by importing it at the top of the post, under the YAML header. I've written about this [before](https://www.robertmylesmcdonnell.com/content/posts/d3_in_MDX/), it's a nice way to do such things.

So ok, all nice JS-associated things, but what about blogging about R, especially if you've code examples? Well, my workflow is quite simple:

- I open up a new RMarkdown document in RStudio;
- I write whatever I'm going to write;
- I use [writeMDX](https://github.com/RobertMyles/writeMDX) to write the .Rmd file to .mdx format;
- I take the .mdx file and put it in the directory I'm using for blog posts and Gatsby renders it as part of the site.

What's writeMDX? It's just a little helper I wrote to take RMarkdown and change it to MDX. If you have an RMarkdown document with the following YAML header:

```
---
title: "MDXtest"
author: "Robert McDonnell"
date: "2/29/2020"
output: html_document
featuredImage: "image/png.png"
---
```

writeMDX will change it to:

```
---
title: "MDXtest
date: "2020-02-29"
featuredImage: "images/some_image.png"
---
```

which is the format I use for my blog posts. What appears here is configurable, so you can change these as you need.

Likewise for the document body. If we have:

```
## writeMDX test

This is a test document for writeMDX. It has **bold**, *italic*

- lists
  - sublists
- and so on

And it has code. For R:
``{r}
x <- 5
print(x)

print(head(mtcars))
``

```

It will become:

````

This is a test document for writeMDX. It has **bold**, _italic_

- lists
  - sublists
- and so on

And it has code. For R:

```{r}
x <- 5
print(x)
```

    ## [1] 5

```{r}
print(head(mtcars))
```

    ##                    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
    ## Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
    ## Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
    ## Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1
    ## Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1
    ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2
    ## Valiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1

```

````

Which renders as:

This is a test document for writeMDX. It has **bold**, _italic_

- lists
  - sublists
- and so on

And it has code. For R:

```r
x <- 5
print(x)

There's usually some fix-up with code, indentations and so on, and a couple of other things, but normally not a lot (maybe placing images in the right place...writeMDX might take of things in future).

So it's really quite simple to include R in a Gatsby site. You can write RMarkdown as you would regularly, run whatever code you normally would and then just transform the result to mdx. (You can also just use regular markdown if you don't want to use MDX.)

There are a couple of things that need to be done differently. For equations, RMarkdown has lovely simple syntax: simply put your equation between `$` or `$$` and RMarkdown takes care of it. With MDX, I do the following. First, import these components from [react-katex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-katex):

```JavaScript
import { InlineMath, BlockMath } from "react-katex"
```

`InlineMath` is like RMarkdown's `$` and `BlockMath` is like `$$`. Then you just use it as you would use any other React component:

```
<BlockMath math="y_{ij} = \beta_j\bf{x_i} - \alpha_j" />
```

Which gives:

<BlockMath math="y_{ij} = \beta_j\bf{x_i} - \alpha_j" />

Like I mentioned above, you might need to change the paths to any images, depending on your setup. Images created from code chunks have a specific way of being in organised in RMarkdown. I source images in blog posts from a subfolder named, surprisingly, `images/`. So if I make something with ggplot2 in a code chunk, this will need to go into `images/` so the .mdx will find it.

So that's how you can use Gatsby for writing about R-related stuff if you're interested. I haven't written about the actual Gatsby/React/JS side of things and how it was for a data scientist to learn all that...maybe some other day.
