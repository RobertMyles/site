        <p>
          I blog (infrequently) about stuff I've learned in R, Python or JS, or
          so on. I like to share it because I learned this way -- from people
          taking time to post tutorials, snippets of code or to write blog
          posts. I built this website using{" "}
          <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>, from -- you guessed it
          -- their tutorials. I used Gatsby because I like React. I like React
          because it makes it easy to include other things as components, such
          as D3, and I wanted a way to put D3 into webpages while still enjoying
          writing webpages. Since I don't enjoy writing HTML, I use markdown, or
          specifically MDX, which allows you to write simple markdown while
          including React (and hence D3); RMarkdown, which allows you to include
          R code (as well as that for other languages) into your markdown, and
          styled components. I built this website as a way to learn how to build
          websites (mostly) from scratch. The design is my own and that was one
          of most challenging parts of it.

          I studied Fine Art in <a href="http://www.ncad.ie">NCAD</a> in Dublin,
          Ireland, International Relations & Political Science in{" "}
          <a href="http://www.dcu.ie">DCU</a>, and I did my PhD in International
          Relations in the{" "}

          My academic work focused on Bayesian item-response models of
          legislative voting, and in my current job, I'm working with huge
          streams of sensitive data in the fraud area.

          When I'm not at the{" "}
          <span style={{ fontFamily: styles.codeFont }}>$DAY_JOB</span>, I'm
          poking around with some R packages, playing the guitar or spending
          some time with my wife and daughter.
