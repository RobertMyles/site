Cryptocurrencies are becoming an interest of mine, since I've got friends who talk about them all the time. So I thought it might be interesting to have a look at a time series of BitCoin, and use the opportunity to do some tidyverse-style time series analysis, in the spirit of [this](http://unconj.ca/blog/forecasting-yyz-passengers-in-the-tidyverse.html) great post. 
The data are availbale from [http://www.coindesk.com/price/](http://www.coindesk.com/price/). Click on `Select All > Export` to download the data. 

First, we import the csv and turn it into a ts object:


```r
bit <- read_csv("../../data/coindesk-bpi-USD-close_data-2010-07-17_2017-04-23.csv") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Date))

bitcoin <- ts(data = bit$`Close Price`, start = c(2010, 7, 7), end = c(2017, 4, 7))
```

We can have a look at the raw data. You could do this by plotting the time series (ts) object using `forecast::plot()`, but here I'll use ggplot2 and the raw data.


```r
ggplot(bit, aes(x = Date, y = `Close Price`)) +
  geom_line(colour = "dodgerblue3") +
  theme_classic()
```

That's quite a volatile time series. There's a definite trend and no apparent seasonality.
