title: "Re-creating Plots from The Economist in R and ggplot2"
date: "2016-08-21"

- 5/2/2017 Update: it seems something is broken in the scripts to run this analysis. I'll fix it asap.\*

The Economist is well known for its graphs and images, and I personally like them a lot. I was doing some work on Brexit when I spied the [image above](http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21702791-britain-unusually-open-trade-unusually-bad-mitigating-its-impact-collateral-damage), and thought how much I would like to make something similar. Since my go-to environment is R, and its go-to plotting package `ggplot2`, I thought I'd try to recreate the image using these tools. (Hat tip: I was half-way through doing this, and getting a little irritated with British place names, when I came across this fantastic [RPub](http://rpubs.com/rouille/191996), which helped a lot with the area names. The code below that deals with cleaning up and merging the administrative area data comes from Benjamin. (\*Edit: this code chunk was hugh, so I think it's better to source it from GitHub gists. That's what the code below does now. The original is [here](https://gist.github.com/RobertMyles/d969a3681bccfc089a202478ff3c1306))

The data that we start off with is available from the UK [Electoral Commission](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/eu-referendum).

```r
library(devtools)
source_gist("d969a3681bccfc089a202478ff3c1306",
            filename = "brexit.R")
```

&nbsp;

So, after all that data tidying, we're ready to make our plot. Since the Economist uses the ITC Officina Sans font, you'll need that on your computer (or something similar). With the `extrafont` package, we can take avail of these, well, extra fonts.

```r
library(extrafont)
font_import()
# There are various folders on my mac with fonts in them:
font_import("/Users/robert/Library/Fonts/")
font_import("/System/Library/Fonts/")
font_import("/Library/Fonts/")
loadfonts()
# see what's available:
fonts()
```

&nbsp;

The following code makes the plot that I wanted, with the image saved and the font that I need embedded in the pdf that is produced. In Rstudio, no text will appear, as this font is not supported. But it'll be in the pdf.

```r
MM <- ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = uk.plot1, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = Import_shock), colour = "white", size = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Reds", breaks = pretty_breaks(n = 8)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = cities.lon, y = cities.lat), color = "black", size = 2.5, shape = 21, fill = "black") +
  geom_point(aes(x = cities.lon, y = cities.lat), color = "white", size = 1, shape = 21, fill = "white") +
  theme_nothing(legend = T) +
  annotate("text", x=-4.75, y=52.5, label="WALES", size=4, family = "ITCOfficinaSans LT Book") +
  annotate("text", x=1.12, y=53.65, label="ENGLAND", size=4, family = "ITCOfficinaSans LT Book") +
  annotate("text", x=-2.2, y=57.9, label="SCOTLAND", size=4, family = "ITCOfficinaSans LT Book") +
  annotate("text", x=-4.7, y=51.42, label="Port Talbot", size=3.45, family = "ITCOfficinaSans LT Book") +
  annotate("text", x=.3, y=52.15, label="Northampton", size=3.45, family = "ITCOfficinaSans LT Book") +
  annotate("segment", x = -3.3, xend = -2.5, y = 54, yend = 54) +
  annotate("segment", x = -2.5, xend = -2.5, y = 54, yend = 53.85) +
  annotate("text", x=-4.22, y=54, label="Blackburn", size=3.45, family = "ITCOfficinaSans LT Book") +
  xlim(range(uk.plot1$long)) + ylim(range(uk.plot1$lat)) +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#A4D3EE", colour = "#A4D3EE"), panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#A4D3EE", colour = "#A4D3EE"), legend.position = "none") +
  coord_map()


ggsave("Brexit_test.pdf", MM)
embed_fonts("Brexit_test.pdf")
```

It's not _exactly_ the same (I could _not_ get that legend to work right!), but I think it's a pretty close match. Good, stuff, R :clap: .

P.s. I know there are themes available to get close to the Economist's image style, but I wanted do it myself :smiley:. Anyway, if you'd like to include the `theme_economist()` function from the `ggthemes` package, it's easy:

```r
Eco <- ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = uk.plot1, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = Import_shock), colour = "white", size = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Reds", breaks = pretty_breaks(n = 8)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = cities.lon, y = cities.lat), color = "black", size = 2.5, shape = 21, fill = "black") +
  geom_point(aes(x = cities.lon, y = cities.lat), color = "white", size = 1, shape = 21, fill = "white") +
  theme_economist() +
  annotate("text", x=-4.75, y=52.5, label="WALES", size=4, family = "ITCOfficinaSans LT Book") +
  annotate("text", x=1.12, y=53.65, label="ENGLAND", size=4, family = "ITCOfficinaSans LT Book") +
  annotate("text", x=-2.2, y=57.9, label="SCOTLAND", size=4, family = "ITCOfficinaSans LT Book") +
  annotate("text", x=-4.7, y=51.42, label="Port Talbot", size=3.45, family = "ITCOfficinaSans LT Book") +
  annotate("text", x=.3, y=52.15, label="Northampton", size=3.45, family = "ITCOfficinaSans LT Book") +
  annotate("segment", x = -3.3, xend = -2.5, y = 54, yend = 54) +
  annotate("segment", x = -2.5, xend = -2.5, y = 54, yend = 53.85) +
  annotate("text", x=-4.22, y=54, label="Blackburn", size=3.45, family = "ITCOfficinaSans LT Book") +
  xlim(range(uk.plot1$long)) + ylim(range(uk.plot1$lat)) +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(), legend.position = "none") +
  coord_map()

ggsave("Brexit_test_Econ.pdf", Eco)
embed_fonts("Brexit_test_Econ.pdf")
```

The combination is better, actually:

If we put them side by side, you can see that we didn't actually do a bad job.
