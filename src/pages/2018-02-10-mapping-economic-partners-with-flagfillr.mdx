Recently I wrote a little package for R called flagfillr (you can read more details [here](https://github.com/RobertMyles/flagfillr)). One of the main reasons I made this is because I had seen a few maps of economic partners, for example this one, from [here](http://drunkeynesian.blogspot.com.br/2017/11/o-que-os-estados-brasileiros-exportam.html):

These types of maps (some more [here](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-state-import-export-international-trade-partner-map-2017-11), of the US) are interesting visual summaries, but they look a little *Excel* to me (sorry, whoever made it!). I thought I could spice them up with flags, cos hey, who doesn't like cool flags (like Bhutan, ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¹, awesome!)

## Enter `flagfillr`

With flagfillr, the above map can easily be created. Once you have a data.frame of the data (here I refer to it as `DF`), you can do it with one line: 

```r
flagfillr::flag_fillr_data(data = DF, country = "Brazil", resolution = "large",
                           size = "250")
```

Which, if your data corresponds to the map above, will give you this:

## Mapping Economic Partners

So how can you do this for another country? Let's take the example of Australia, from data available [here](http://dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/trade-at-a-glance/Pages/goods-by-state.aspx). First of all, we'll need to put our data into a dataframe, preferably with columns named `country`, `state` and `partner`, just to keep things simple. Simple is good. I'll use `dplyr` here (don't forget you'll have to install flagfillr, see [here](https://github.com/RobertMyles/flagfillr)). Since Australia's main trade partners by state are basically China and Japan, let's choose the *third* biggest trade partner by state, just to keep things interesting. 


```r
library(dplyr)
library(flagfillr) 
library(plotly)

oz <- tibble(
  country = "Australia",
  state = c("Northern Territory", "Western Australia", "New South Wales",
            "South Australia", "Victoria", "Queensland", "Tasmania",
            "Australian Capital Territory"),
  partner = c("India", "United Kingdom", "South Korea", "Malaysia", "New Zealand",
              "India", "Malaysia", "Malaysia")
)

flag_fillr_data(oz, country = "Australia", type = "state", size = "250",
                partner_col = oz$partner, state_col = oz$state)
```

It's not surprising that we see these countries here (the principal partners are China, Japan and India). Indeed, for many countries, the main economic partners are not a surprise. Let's take a look at the mainland United States. We can recreate these plots with flagfillr (for more detailed data see [here](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/data/index.html)), and make them a little prettier (they come from [here](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-state-import-export-international-trade-partner-map-2017-11)).

First, let's make the data:  


```r
states <- state.name
imports <- tibble(
  state = states,
  partner = NA_character_
) %>% 
  mutate(partner = case_when(
    state %in% c("Oregon", "Indiana") ~ "Ireland",
    state == "Louisiana" ~ "Saudi Arabia",
    state == "Alabama" ~ "South Korea",
    state %in% c("South Carolina", "Maryland", "Rhode Island") ~ "Germany",
    state == "Delaware" ~ "United Kingdom",
    state %in% c("Texas", "Arizona", "Utah") ~ "Mexico",
    state %in% c("Washington", "Montana", "Wyoming", "Colorado", "North Dakota", 
                 "South Dakota", "Iowa", "Oklahoma", "West Virginia", "Maine",
                 "New Hampshire", "Vermont", "Massachusetts", "Connecticut") ~"Canada",
    TRUE ~ "China"
  ))


flag_fillr_data(imports, country = "United States", type = "state", size = "250",
                partner_col = imports$partner, state_col = imports$state)
```

Maybe that's a slightly disturbing vision to some people haha! I like to think it's a nice reminder of how intertwined our world is. And some surprises in there...Ireland, South Korea, Saudi Arabia. Seems like Ireland exports tech [products](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/data/wy.html) to Oregon, while Louisiana imports -- you guessed it -- oil from Saudi Arabia. How about the countries that these states most export to?


```r
exports <- tibble(
  state = states,
  partner = NA_character_
) %>% 
  mutate(partner = case_when(
    state %in% c("Oregon", "Washington", "Louisiana", "South Carolina") ~ "China",
    state == "Nevada" ~ "Switzerland",
    state %in% c("Utah", "Delaware") ~ "United Kingdom",
    state %in% c("Wyoming", "Florida") ~ "Brazil",
    state == "Connecticut" ~ "France",
    state %in% c("California", "Texas", "Arizona", "New Mexico", "Nebraska", 
                 "Kansas") ~ "Mexico",
    TRUE ~ "Canada"
  ))


flag_fillr_data(exports, country = "United States", type = "state", size = "250",
                partner_col = exports$partner, state_col = exports$state)
```

Interesting. What does Utah export to the UK? The "state export[s] a broad range of goods, including animal products, aircraft engines, automotive parts, electronics, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, sporting goods, and industrial goods such as valves, drilling tools and fuses", [supposedly](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865601174/British-diplomat-lauds-UK-trade-relations-with-Utah.html). Brazil and Wyoming also have an interesting relationship, with Wyoming's exports being [chemicals and the like](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/data/wy.html). 


Another interesting case that makes for an arresting visualization is the internal trade of European Union. Eurostat presents it to us in this format:

But we can make it prettier! Here I skip the code, but the pattern is the same as the above two plots. You might notice French Guyana sneaking in there -- it's officialy part of France, so it's included in the geometry column used for plotting. In the future, it'd be great to have a clean, easy way to filter it out, but right now that means messing with geometry list-columns, and that's a bit messy.

So these are a few examples of the things you can do with flagfillr. Maybe in a future post I'll map some state-level trade for the countries that have state flags in the package (the Netherlands, for example).
