Here's a test page. It's got footnotes[^1], and _italics_, **bold**, and even **_bold italics_**.

```r
x <- 5:3
text = "I like text!"
if(TRUE) NULL
```

## header 2

### header 3

There are [links](www.google.com) and `inline code`.

> There are also blockquotes.

[^1]: This is that footnote I was talkin' bout.
