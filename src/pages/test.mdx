### hello!

Here's a test page. It's got footnotes[^1], and _italics_, **bold**, and even **_bold italics_**.
We can even make a really long sentence just for the hell of it, because I want to see the spacing - which should be OK, but you never know, eh?

```r
x <- 5:3
text = "I like text!"
if(TRUE) NULL
```

## header 2

This is the React part:

And a div;

<div style={{ padding: "20px", backgroundColor: "green" }}>
  <h3>This is JSX</h3>
</div>

### header 3

There are [links](www.google.com) and `inline code`.

> There are also blockquotes.

[^1]: This is that footnote I was talkin' bout.
