### hello!

Here's a test page. It's got footnotes[^1], and _italics_, **bold**, and even **_bold italics_**.
We can even make a really long sentence just for the hell of it, because I want to see the spacing - which should be OK, but you never know, eh?

Let's make some equations. Here's an inline one: $x = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1$. And a display mode one:
$$y_i = \alpha_j + \beta_{ji}$$

$$x \times y \propto z$$

$ x \times y$

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

$$

\left( \sum*{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum*{k=1}^n a*k^2 \right) \left( \sum*{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)

$$

Here's some code:

```javascript
x = 5
text = `I like text! ${x}`
z === NULL
```

```js
x = 5
text = `I like text! ${x}`
z === null
true
```

```r
x = 5
text = `I like text! ${x}`
z === NULL
TRUE
y*5
```

We can also have some `inline code`.

Let's see if it recognises R:

```r
x <- 5:3
y = NULL
# a comment
x <- function(y, z) {
  if(x >= 5) {
    kill()
  } else {
    dont()
  }
}
```

or SQL

```sql
SELECT * FROM 'TBL'
```

and...

```
<--! hello -->
text
```

```jsx{1,4-6}
<React className="idiot">{tyke!}</React>
render()
```

and bash:

```bash
ls -a
echo -e "\nRemoving \t backslash \t characters\n"
```

```python
import pandas as pd
x = pd.read_csv("this/is/a/file.csv")
x.columns()
```

# header 1

## header 2

This is the React part:

And a div;

<div style={{ padding: "20px", backgroundColor: "green" }}>
  <h3>This is JSX</h3>
</div>

### header 3

There are [links](www.google.com) and `inline code`.

> There are also blockquotes.

[^1]: This is that footnote I was talkin' bout.
