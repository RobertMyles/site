    <h4>I'm Robert McDonnell, welcome to my little site.</h4>

    <p>
      I blog (infrequently) about stuff I've learned in R, or JS, or so on. I
      like to share it 'cos I learned that way -- from people taking time to
      post tutorials etc. I built this website using
      <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>, from -- you guessed it --
      their tutorials. I used Gatsby 'cos I like React.
    </p>

    <p>
      I studied Fine Art in <a href="http://www.ncad.ie">NCAD</a> in Dublin,
      Ireland, International Relations & Political Science in{" "}
      <a href="http://www.dcu.ie">DCU</a>, and I did my PhD in International
      Relations in the University of SÃ£o Paulo.
    </p>

    <p>
      My academic work focused on Bayesian item-response models of legislative
      voting, and in my current job, I'm working with huge streams of sensitive
      data in the fraud area.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not at the $DAY_JOB, I'm poking around with some R packages,
      playing the guitar or spending some time with my wife and daughter.
